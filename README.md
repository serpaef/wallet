# Wallet

This application computes expenses in different currencies and converts everything to a single currency, which can be chosen by the user.

**Based on the TrybeWallet project owned by the Trybe development school.**

The currency quote information will be retrieved from the API endpoint <a href="https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas">Cotação de moedas</a>

## What I used?

Basically, React, Redux, ReactRouter and MaterialUI.
